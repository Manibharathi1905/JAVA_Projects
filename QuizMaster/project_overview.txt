QuizMaster Project Overview

QuizMaster is a console-based quiz application built in Java, designed to demonstrate clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and professional software architecture. The project emphasizes separation of concerns, modularity, and error handling, making it a solid example of enterprise-level Java development.

Key Features:
- Clean OOP Architecture: Utilizes classes, interfaces, and inheritance for maintainable code.
- Package Structure: Organized into logical packages (core, models, services, utils, exceptions) for better code organization.
- File I/O: Loads quiz questions from a text file (questions.txt) with a specific format.
- Score Tracking: Tracks correct and wrong answers, calculates total score.
- Utility Classes: Includes helper classes for user interaction and data parsing.
- Error Handling: Custom exceptions for invalid question formats and robust file reading.
- Fully Runnable: Compiles and runs directly from the command line without external dependencies.

Project Structure:
- src/com/quizmaster/
  - Main.java: Entry point of the application.
  - core/: Core business logic (QuizEngine, ScoreManager, QuestionParser).
  - models/: Data models (Question, Score).
  - services/: Service layer (QuestionService interface, FileQuestionService implementation).
  - utils/: Utility classes (ConsoleUI for user interaction).
  - exceptions/: Custom exceptions (QuestionFormatException).

How to Run:
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: javac src/com/quizmaster/**/*.java
3. Run: java -cp src com.quizmaster.Main

The application will load questions from questions.txt, shuffle them, present them to the user via console input, and display the final score upon completion.

Technologies Used:
- Java (standard library only, no external dependencies).
- File I/O for data persistence.
- Collections framework for data manipulation.
- Exception handling for robustness.

This project serves as an excellent template for building console-based applications with a focus on clean architecture and best practices.

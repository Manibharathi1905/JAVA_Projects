CoreBank System - Project Overview

Overview:
The CoreBank System is a console-based simple banking application developed in Java. It showcases core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming such as inheritance and encapsulation, and utilizes an SQL database backend for data persistence.

Key Features:
- Supports two types of accounts: SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount, using inheritance from a base Account class.
- Basic banking operations including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers between accounts, and balance inquiries.
- Transaction logging with viewing capability for all account-related transactions.
- SQLite/MySQL database integration for persistent data storage.

Architecture:
1. Models:
   - Account.java (abstract base)
   - SavingsAccount.java (concrete subclass)
   - CurrentAccount.java (concrete subclass with overdraft)

2. Services:
   - AccountService.java: Manages accounts CRUD operations connecting to database.
   - TransactionService.java: Manages transaction logs and history.

3. Database Layer:
   - Database.java: Singleton connection to the database (SQLite or MySQL).
   - setup.sql: SQL schema for accounts and transactions tables.

4. Entry Point:
   - Main.java: Console user interface to interact with the system features in a menu.

Usage:
- Compile all Java files ensuring the SQL JDBC driver is in classpath.
- Configure database connection parameters in Database.java.
- Run Main.java and operate via the text menu.

The system provides a foundational and extensible platform for banking system simulation with essential banking features.

Critical Functionalities to Test After MySQL Transition:

1. Account Management:
   - Creating new Savings or Current accounts with valid input data.
   - Handling invalid input or unsupported account types during account creation.
   - Fetching account details accurately from the database.

2. Financial Transactions:
   - Depositing an amount correctly updates the account balance.
   - Withdrawing an amount considers balance and overdraft limit (for CurrentAccount), prevents overdrawing beyond limits.
   - Transferring funds deducts from sender and adds to receiver, with appropriate balance validations.
   - Handling failed transactions gracefully without corrupting data.

3. Transaction Logging:
   - All deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations are logged with correct metadata (type, amount, account id, timestamp).
   - Ability to retrieve and display transaction history per account.

4. Database Integration:
   - All account and transaction changes persist correctly in the MySQL database.
   - Proper handling of SQL exceptions and resource management (connections, statements).
   - Foreign key constraints between transactions and accounts work as intended.

5. Console UI and Input Handling:
   - Menu-driven interface correctly maps user choices to operations.
   - Input validations prevent crashes or invalid data entry.
   - Appropriate user feedback/messages for success/failure cases.

Testing Scope Options:
- Critical-path testing covering main happy paths of account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction logging.
- Thorough testing with full coverage including error paths, invalid inputs, edge cases like overdraft limits, empty transaction history, and database failures.
